# pilgrimage

I have used flutter sdk for and firebase ( authentication and database backend ) to develop project pilgrimage.
 the app opens with a authentication screen in which the user can either sign up if he/she is a new use or login if his/her account already exists. 
 The user can login from any device as long as the app is installed on it.
Upon login the user gets a stream of photos as posts which he can like or dislike..... any changes in the number of likes are reflected on all devices .
The images metatdata is stored in firebase storage service
Sign-out and developer information is provided in the app drawer .

You can find the Downloadable apk file (android only) for my project here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cPMKgaK5Iq8TEzqEm8UtK5cEEKHtwTgM/view?usp=sharing
